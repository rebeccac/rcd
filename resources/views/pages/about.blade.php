    <h2>About Rebecca Cordingley</h2>

    <p>
        I grew up in Adelaide, South Australia, and moved to Melbourne, then the Macedon Ranges in Victoria before deciding to move back to Adelaide in 2014.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm happiest when I have art in my life. I'm a programmer/web developer (with a couple of other degrees) but I always end up coming back to art.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was a lampwork glass artist for several years, then had a break for a few years while I went back to university to study computer science. I've recently started silversmithing and love it.
    </p>
    <p>
        In between (and still), there's been photography, knitting, crochet, sewing... anything that allows me to use my hands and mind to be creative. Even programming can be surprisingly creative.
    </p>
    <p>
        I love the sense of accomplishment that comes from turning a pile of raw materials into something (hopefully) beautiful or useful.
    </p>
    <p>
        All my items are handmade, by me, in my studio in Adelaide, South Australia. I use recycled/reclaimed materials whenever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope you like my work.
